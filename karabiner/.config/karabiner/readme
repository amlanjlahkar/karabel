Personal rules for karabiner elements (https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).

** Generation
The "generators" directory contains the jsonnet templates used for generating the corresponding complex_modification files in json format.

The makefile can be used to simplify the generation process.

# Install dependencies, generate the targets(if modified)
# and symlink the karabiner directory to ~/.config/karabiner
# NOTE: should only be used the first time
make init

# simply run make to generate the new/outdated targets
make
