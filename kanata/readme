Personal configuration for kanata (https://github.com/jtroo/kanata).

** Note
In mac, kanata relies on karabiner's virtual hid client (https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice) for emulating key events. So the driver must be installed and accessible by kanata to function properly. The instructions for setting it up is in the repository's readme.
